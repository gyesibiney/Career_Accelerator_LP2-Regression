## Project Description
# Business understanding
A time series is a sequence of data points that are indexed and ordered chronologically over time. Time series data can be observed at regular or irregular intervals and can be collected over any time period, ranging from seconds to decades or even centuries. Time series data can be univariate (i.e., a single variable is recorded over time) or multivariate (i.e., multiple variables are recorded over time).Favorita Corporation is an Ecuadorian company that creates and invests in the commercial, industrial and real estate areas. Its subsidiaries have activities in six countries in the region, including Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Colombia, Costa Rica and Chile. They offer the best products, services and experiences in an efficient, sustainable and responsible way to improve the quality of life. 

The aim of this project is to forecast the unit sales of the products across different stores. This is to optimize their inventory management , marketing strategies  and pricing  decisions. To achieve this results, we employed the use of time series in collaboration with different machine learning algorithms via the CRISP-DM framework. 

The objective of this analysis is to select the best prediction model from the different ML algorithms tested. This model will be the solution to be adopted by the company to help Favorita Corporation make insightful decisions in relation to their retail sales ,promotion and customer statisfaction. 

## Hypothesis
- Null Hypothesis:
Promotional activities have a significant impact on the store sales at Corporation Favorita.

- Alternate Hypothesis:
Promotional activities does not have a significant impact on the store sales at Corporation Favorita.

## Questions
Q1. which city had the highest stores

Q2. which month did we have the highest sale

Q3. which store had the highest transaction?

Q4. which store had the highest sale?

Q5. what is the most bought product?


## Setup
...Install the required packages to be able to run the evaluation locally.
You need to have [`Python 3`](https://www.python.org/) on your system (**a Python version lower than 3.10**). Then you can clone this repo and being at the repo's `root :: repository_name> ...`  follow the steps below:

- Windows *(Python should be added to the Path variable of environment)*:
        
        python3 -m venv venv; venv\Scripts\activate; python -m pip install --upgrade pip; python -m pip install -r requirements.txt  

- Linux & MacOs:
        
        python3 -m venv venv; source venv/bin/activate; python -m pip install --upgrade pip; python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

The both long command-lines have a same structure, they pipe multiple commands using the symbol **;** but you may manually execute them one after another.

1. **Create the Python's virtual environment** that isolates the required libraries of the project to avoid conflicts;
2. **Activate the Python's virtual environment** so that the Python kernel & libraries will be those of the isolated environment;
3. **Upgrade Pip, the installed libraries/packages manager** to have the up-to-date version that will work correctly;
4. **Install the required libraries/packages** listed in the `requirements.txt` file so that it will be allow to import them into the python's scripts and notebooks without any issue.

## App Execution
...This evaluation will be automatically grade, so please follow the instructions carefully. 

You can run this command bellow being at the root of the repository to be sure your solutions are the good ones before to push your solutions.
```command
